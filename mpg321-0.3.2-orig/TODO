* Make sure that removing the if (quit_now) stuff from mpg321.c didn't wreck
  remote control mode
* fix repeating end of file for pipes

Please help! This list is in the order I (generally) want to get to them.
Version 0.3.0 will support buffering and proxies (please help). 
Red Hat users, RPMs and good spec files would be appreciated.

* Buffering. mpg123 uses shared memory (mitshm); one process decodes all data,
  and places it in a user-specified size buffer; the other outputs it to the
  sound card independently of the decoding process.
* We need to make sure we're always doing the right thing wrt seeking
  and buffering when playing over the network. I don't think we special-case
  network enough, and there are definitely bugs. Oh yes.
* Error message printing, like mpg123 - just need to hook in an error
  handler function on mad_decoder_init.
* Look at downsampling in madplay to duplicate for mpg321
* Look up information as to how to implement -o h, -o s, -o l on sun machines
  (headphones, speakers, line out) - probably just an ioctl. Maybe roll
  this support into libao.
* RPM files, of mpg321 and its dependencies (mad and libao)

On-going potential design and speed improvements:
* The routines read_header and output in mad.c are absolutely critical to 
  performance, because they're called for every single frame in the mp3 file.
  If there are any gains to be made within the mpg321 code, this is it. I
  encourage any performance-minded hackers to take a look.
* MAD itself could possibly benefit from more speed work.
  The best places to optimize performance are probably synthesis 
  (synth.c:synth_full()), the Layer III IMDCT (layer3.c:imdct36()),
  and maybe Layer III Huffman decoding (layer3.c:III_huffdecode()).
  To help out with MAD, contact Rob Leslie <rob@mars.org>
* A lot of the design is pretty disjointed and sketchy at best. I know about 
  this, but sometimes I just don't have the will, desire, or time to do the
  'right thing.' I welcome better people than I to improve upon it.
