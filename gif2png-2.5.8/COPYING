Part of gif2png (the file 437_l1.c) was generated by the `trans'
program written by Kosta Kostis <kosta@kostis.net>.  This package
(a great source for character conversion tables) is available from
<http://www.kostis.net/>.

The PNG specification is available from <http://libpng.org/pub/png>.
Obviously, without the PNG effort this program wouldn't have been
possible or necessary (or even conceivable).
